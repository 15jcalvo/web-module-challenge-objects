/* 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 Task 1a: Make a function that builds objects (constructor function)🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Add to the function createMenuItems below so it will create objects following the same format found above for latte and breakfastBurrito (name, price, category).  
The function should:
  1. Receive values for the object that will be created
  2. Create and return an object using the received values  
  
  HINT - we are basically creating a constructor function here (a function that creates and returns objects) 
*/

/* 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 Task 1b: 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Test your createMenuItems function by doing the following:
  1. Pass values to createMenuItems in order to create the objects (menu items)
  2. Create at least 3 menu items (objects) of your choosing making sure they have name, price, and category keys
  3. Log each returned object to the console  
  
  For example: createMenuItem("pizza",5,"lunch") would return this as the object: {name:"Pizza",price:5,category:"lunch"}

/* 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 Task 2: 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
You're having a lunch special! 25% off for teachers and students, 10% off for everyone else. Add a method to the 
burger object below that automatically calculates price depending on the a string received as a parameter. 

Using the burger object below do the following:
  1. Add a method called discount to the burger object 
  2. The discount method should accept a string that could be "teacher", "student", or "public"
  2. Depending on the string, it will return the correct price
  3. Log the correct returned price to the console

  For example: burger.discount("teacher") would return 13.5 and burger.discount("public") would return 16.2

/* 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 Task 6: 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Write a function to return a review based on the index of the review in the array.

 Your function should take two arguments:

(1) an array which holds all of the reviews
(2) a number which is the desired index in the array.

and should return a string in the format `{name} gave the restaurant a {rating}, and their feedback was: {feedback}`

 * For example, if getReviewByIndex is invoked with reviews and the number 0
 * it will return `Daniela gave the restaurant a 5 star review and their feedback was: Beautiful atmosphere and wonderful vegan options!`

getLastReview should accept:
  (1) an array of objects 
  
and should return a string in the format `name} gave the restaurant a {rating}, and their feedback was: {feedback}`

For example, if getLastReview is invoked passing the reviews array it will return `Reyna gave the restaurant a 3.5 star review and their feedback was: "this place is chill with really cool people, great for getting work done on weekdays"`.

Write a function called carMarker 

Your function should accept:

(1) a single odometer argument (a number) 

and return an object.

The returned object should have the following characteristics:
     it has an `odometer` property that contains the argument passed in.
     it has a `drive` method that takes a distance as its argument, and
         (1) causes the odometer in the object to be increased by the distance,
         (2) returns the updated value of the `odometer`.
